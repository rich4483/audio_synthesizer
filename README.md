# audio_synthesizer
Audio Synthesizer based on Atmel microcontroller

As development of this project pre-dates GitHub, this repo is used for sharing purposes only. It is not a development repo. It contains:

- 941-01A6.pdf (PDF schematic of hardware design)
- 941-01x5.asm (Assembly language source code)

The schematic was created using Protel schematic capture (later acquired by Altium). 

Features:
- Four output channels, with independent local volume control
- Remote tune selection via serial communication
- Remote volume control via serial communication
- RS485 serial communication
- Numeric display of currently playing tune number
- In-circuit reprogramming capability


I designed the hardware and firmware for this audio synthesizer in 2001. The use of assembly language seems ancient by todayâ€™s standards. But at the time, it was common practice in our company to use assembly language targeting Atmel microcontrollers for new hardware projects. We had a well established code library and tools for this development work.

We also used C extensively for some projects, but when working with an 8-bit micro with very limited resources (i.e. only 8kB of flash, and 256 bytes of RAM), it is critical to be as efficient as possible. In this environment, writing assembly code offered many advantages.
